## <ins>Objective</ins>

A-LOTTA-RHYTHMS is an online social platform where music enthusiasts can connect with each other and create music together. 


## <ins>Experience</ins>

when a user creates an account on this site, they will be sent to the main page that has all of the existing posts displayed. They can filter the posts and add comments wherever they want. Then, they can navigate to their profile and update their bio, their profile pic, and even add some instruments to their user. When a user makes a post, they select a "Rhythm" which is essentially hte category of what their post is about. All users on this site should be able to take advantages to posts/comments to coordinate with other music enthusiasts to meet all of their musical needs

There are may ways we can improve this site. As-is, it can be considered an MVP or a proof of concept. We'd like to continue developing it and eventually have a social media site that's on par with Facebook, Soundcloud, or at least Myspace. 

Some future features:
-Add photo collections
-Allow users to load their own music to their posts and profiles
